<h3>Joshua Anderson: Technology Enthusiast</h3>
<p>
My experience since graduating with a Bachelors Degree from Syracuse University in 2011 has 
been quite unconventional in that the opportunities I was given allowed me to flourish in 
numerous roles and attain a high level of responsibility and personal accountability early on in 
my career. At 24 years old, I have already worked for two fortune 500 companies as well as had 
my fair share of entrepreneurial experiences, which has allowed me to reach levels of individual 
success as well as some depth of failure. I mention my failures because I truly believe as a leader
and as someone still early in their career, I have learned so much more from my defeats then I 
have from my victories.

<p>
No matter what tasks, roles, or responsibilities I have taken on in my career, I have always 
performed them with great quality and leadership. I have led teams of talented individuals, given 
professional presentations to investors and audiences of hundreds of people, and closed 
consulting deals worth thousands of dollars all while pursuing (and completing) a Masters 
Degree in Information Technology Management. My Master's Degree was afforded to me 
through a Kauffman Entrepreneurial Fellowship and scholarships from Syracuse University as an
acknowledgement of the leadership qualities they believe I have and will continue to show in the 
tech industry.

Over the past 2 years I've grown my technical understanding for: Ruby on Rails, PHP, HTML, 
CSS, and JQuery so that I can better interface with developers and take on that responsibility if 
necessary. I also possess hands on experience with Search Engine Optimization, building 
Ecommerce based products, and have been designing and building websites for the past 7 years.
